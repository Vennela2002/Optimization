# Optimization
# Introduction
The preparation of a battery separator using the electrospinning method involves creating a porous, fibrous membrane to improve ion conductivity and battery performance. Key to this process is optimizing parameters like polymer concentration, solvent type, flow rate, tip to collector distance, and voltage, which influence the fiber formation, structural integrity, and performance of the separator. Proper tuning of these factors ensures the separator meets the required mechanical and electrochemical properties for efficient battery operation.
